## Tech stack:
- React for the frontend
- Django for the backend
- Django REST framework for the API allowing them to communicate

## Features:
- Gameplay
  - Make, erase & undo moves
  - Validation mode (highlights incorrect guesses when turned on)
  - Play sudokus of different sizes and varying difficulties
  - Light & dark themes
- Backend
  - Sudoku solver using integer programming
  - Sudoku generation - the algorithm I came up with is:
    - Randomly shuffle a solved sudoku, ensuring the solution remains valid
    - Randomly remove a certain number of clues
    - Attempt solving the sudoku and check that the solution is unique
  - Player identification
  - Persistence of current game state and historic games
